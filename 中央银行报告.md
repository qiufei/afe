# The labor market

Labor market conditions strengthened further across a variety of dimensions over the second half of 2015.

## employment numbers ##


![plot of chunk labor market](figure/labor market-1.png)![plot of chunk labor market](figure/labor market-2.png)![plot of chunk labor market](figure/labor market-3.png)

## employment rate ##

Changing demographics--most notably the increasing share of older people in the population, who are less likely to be in the labor force--and other longer-run structural changes in the labor market have continued to push down the participation rate even as cyclical forces have been pushing it up.

That said, labor force participation appears to remain a little weaker than can be explained by structural factors alone, pointing to the likelihood that some slack remains in this dimension of labor utilization.

In addition, although the share of workers who are employed part time but would like to work full time has fallen noticeably since June, it is still relatively high, indicating some scope for improvement on this dimension as well.

## labor compensation ##

compensation per hour in the business sector--a volatile measure derived from the labor compensation data in the national income and product accounts, or NIPA--is reported to have increased more quickly in 2015 than its average pace throughout most of the recovery.

the employment cost index for private industry workers, which measures both wages and the cost to employers of providing benefits, increased about 2 percent over the 12 months ending in December, similar to the pace seen throughout most of the recovery. All of these measures of compensation are increasing at slower rates than those seen prior to the recession.

This deceleration probably reflects a variety of factors, including the slower growth of productivity, the slower pace of inflation, and perhaps some remaining slack in the labor market.

![plot of chunk all credit](figure/all credit-1.png)

浅绿色柱状带标出的是2007,2008两年间的数据.

1. 中国信贷占GDP的比重不是最高的.
最上面蓝色与红色分别是日本和美国的数据,可以看到美国信贷占GDP的比重在2008年达到最大,也是在这一年,次贷危机全面爆发.

从这里我们易于得出当信贷占GDP的比重达到高点时,会爆发金融危机的结论.比如美国2001年也到达一个高点,那一年附近美国互联网泡沫破灭.
但是日本前一个高点在1998,1999年附近,那两年似乎日本没有什么大的的危机发生?

2. 中国在2008年后开始高速加杠杆
中间绿色和棕色分别是中国和德国的数据,中贷款占GDP的比重与德国的水平相似,并且这两个国家的共同特点是当美日这一指标在2007年达到高点时,中德两国达到低点.
中国尤其特殊的地方是,当2008年后美德日三国都开始去杠杆的时候(表现为这一指标的下降),中国开始高速加杠杆,指标值快速上升.

3. 目前世界的信贷占GDP的比重处在历史上的最高水平.

世界1984-2005之间,世界总体的信贷占GDP的比重是比较平稳的,此后一直上升.

一个疑问:中国信贷占GDP的比重在2003年达到过一个高点,不知道那一年发生了什么?
